# Data Science Internship at Bhart Intern
During my internship at Bhart Intern, I had the opportunity to work on two significant projects: number recognition and the Titanic dataset. This experience allowed me to apply and expand my data science and machine learning skills in a practical setting.

# Project Overview
1. Number Recognition

Objective: Develop and train machine learning models to accurately recognize handwritten digits.
Approach: Utilized datasets like MNIST, applied preprocessing techniques, and trained models using various algorithms including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Outcome: Achieved high accuracy in digit recognition, demonstrating the efficacy of the models.

2. Titanic Dataset

Objective: Analyze the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival outcomes based on various features.
Approach: Performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and built predictive models using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
Outcome: Developed models with robust predictive power, providing insights into the factors affecting survival rates.
